-------------------------

Untar the jigl-X.x.tgz file:

> tar zxvf jiglX.x.tgz

This will create the directory jigl-X.x. In that directory copy the jigl.pl
file to a directory in your path and make the file executable.

> cp jigl-X.x/jigl.pl /usr/local/bin
> chmod a+rx /usr/local/bin/jigl.pl

You should now be able to use jigl from anywhere.

>./jigl --help

jigl does NOT work on versions of windows before windows 2000. This includes
Windows ME, 98/95 and anything else that's not 2000 or XP. :)

Please make sure you have the required programs installed before trying to
run jigl. You will need perl, ImageMagick and jhead. If you don't have these

Note: These instructions are for Windows 2000.  Windows XP will likely be
similiar but may not match exactly.

Changing the Environment: (or how your computer knows where programs are)
-------------------------
The PATH is a parameter that tells your computer where certain files live on
your harddrive.  By setting this parameter, you can simply type the name of
a program at the command line and cause it to run.  For example, if you open
a command prompt and type notepad, the Windows Notepad program will start up.

In order for jigl to run, your computer needs to know where to find it.
* Choose a directory to place jigl.pl.  I use C:\bin.
* Copy the jigl.pl file from the jigl-X.x.tgz file (winzip should handle this
  with out a problem) to the directory you chose above.

   * Start -> Settings -> Control Panel -> System
     (or hit Windows Key-Pause/Break)
   * Select Advanced tab
   * Select Environment Variables
   * In either User Variables or System Variables, select PATH.
   * Hit the Edit... button

   * In Variable Value, add the directory you chose above
      (for example, C:\bin) to the end of the list. Separate
      it from the other directories with a semicolon (;).
   WARNING: Be careful to save the other directories that are
      listed there.  If you delete them, hit Cancel and the
      start back at the Edit... instructions.

   * Hit OK (Closes the edit box)

   * Select New... in the User variables section (top half of window)
   * Fill in the box as follows:
      Variable Name: HOME
      Variable Value: C:\Documents and Settings\name
          where name is the name you use to access your computer
   * Hit OK (Closes the edit box)
   * Hit OK (Closes the Environment Variables)
   * Hit OK (Closes the System Properties)

Testing the install:
-------------------
   * Open a command prompt (Start -> Programs -> Accessories -> Command Prompt)
   * Type path.  Look through the output and make sure the directory you just
     added is in the list.
   * Type jigl.pl --help. The program should run and you should see all the
     options available to you.
   * Type exit to close the command prompt window.
Note: When changing the PATH or installing programs, such as those
   below, that modify the PATH, you must open a new Command Prompt in
   order to see the changes.  You do not need to reboot your machine.
