Version : 2.0.1
Date    : 11/13/2003
- Fixed bug where quoted strings weren't being handled correctly in the
  gallery.dat and jigl.opts file. Thanks to Phill Collins (not the singer)
  for pointing me to the Text::ParseWords module.
- Fixed a few references in the code to the old .jiglrc file.
Version : 2.0
Date    : 10/24/2003
- ~/.jiglrc was moved to be ~/.jigl/jigl.opts. The old ~/.jiglrc file will NO
  LONGER be recognized!!
- Added a print statement for each picture that gets auto rotated.
- Fixed bug in themes where short keys that are sub-strings of longer
  keys were causing problems when the html pages were generated. Thanks to
  R.K.Owen for finding this!
- Added --theme <theme_name> option.
- Themes are stores in ~/.jigl/themes. The default theme is also stored here
  and is created by the jigl.
- We no longer store copies of the template files in the local gallery dir.
  These are all stored in the theme directories and read from there. However,
  if local template files are found, it will continue to use those. It's
  recommended that you use the new themes tho. To do this, simply call jigl
  with the -ut option. (see below)
- The -ut|--update-template option now removes local as well as global template
  files. This will cause you to recreate the default theme directory.
- Added -gs|--generate-slides option. This will cause slide pages to be created.
- Added -gi|--generate-info option. This will cause info pages to be created.
- Added -wd|--web-dir option. This allows you to specify a directory where
  the gallery will be copied once jigl is done running. The default is ./web.
- Added -gbs|--go-back-string option. Allows user to set the "Go Back" string
  on the index.html page. Default is still "Go Back". html could be used to
  include an image instead of just text.
  Ex: -gbs "<img src=theme/gbimg.gif border=0>" That would use the image,
  "theme/go-back.gif" as the go back link.
- First slides/info-pages <<Prev|<<Prev-info links were removed. Now just says
  "First Slide" or "First Info". A tag was moved into the theme file for this
  link, so you can change it to say or link to whatever you want.
- Last slides/info-pages Next>>|Next-info>> links were removed. Now just says
  "Last Slide" or "Last Info". A tag was moved into the theme file for this
  link, so you can change it to say or link to whatever you want.
- A few bug fixes and code cleanup as well.
====================
Version : 1.1
Date    : 06/03/2003
- Added directory recursion through the -r|--recurse option. This option
  will only be recognized when called from the command line. This is to help
  prevent accidental recursive calls if -r was stored in the gallery.dat file
  or in the users $HOME/.jigrc file. The recursion will take place for ALL of
  the directories passed in on the command line, or "." if none are specified.
- Fixed recursion to not walk into the 'slides' and 'thumbs' directories
- Used the $slideDir and $thumbDir variables in the recursion check.
- Applied patch from Guy Brand to use POSIX localtime processing and to
  correct the mkdir calls to include the mask 0755.
- Added -aro|--auto-rotate-originals option. Does lossless rotation on
  original images if they support the exif "Orientation" tag. Requires jhead
  version 2.0 or greater and jpegtran.
- Added -uec|--use-exif-comment option. Extracts the exif Comment field and
  makes that the description of the slides. If used in conjunction with the
  -cg option, the exif comment will be saved in the new gallery.dat file.
- Added -it|--index-title option. Sets the gallery's titlebar/title. To be
  used when not using a gallery.dat file.
- Added -ir|--index-row option. Allows for multiple index pages to be 
  generated. This requires the user to update their current index_template
  files. See the -ut option that was also added.
- Added -ut|--update-templates option which removes the slide, thumb and 
  index template files. jigl then replaces them with the latest version.
- We now remove all the html files in the directory (mathing index*.html
  and [1-9]*.html) before we create new ones. This is to prevent stale files
  that may exist when the number of index files or slides changes from one
  run of jigl to another.
- Changed the default go-back-url to "../index.html" from simply ".."
====================
Version : 1.0
Date    : 05/06/2003
- Removed options that weren't going to be supported for this release.
  New ideas will be listed in a TODO document of some sort.
- Cleaned up the --help output a bit. Fixed some typos and other small stuff.
- Removed EXIF-INFO-FULL-TABLE tag processing from the info_template
  processing since we didn't use it.
- Added necessary support for themes. This involved adding the ability to
  specify the background color to the INDEX-HEADER, INDEX-FOOTER and PICTURES
  tags in the index_template file. See the THEMES file for more info on
  theme support in jigl.
- Changed the behavior of the slide scaling function. Now the slide will only
  be scaled if the height of the original image is greater than the sy option.
  Otherwise the original image will simply be copied.
- Added -iy|--infoY option. This option was added to prevent small slide
  images from getting unnecessarily smaller on the info pages.
- Somehow the sizeToKb function worked it's way back into the code. It should
  be removed for good now.
- Fixed a small bug where the -gb option was adding more that one instace of
  the Go Back link to the header. (dwj)
====================
Version : 1.0rc4
Date    : 04/02/2003
- NAME CHANGE!! Due to a name conflict with another program I have decided
  to change the name of the project. jGal is now jigl, which is short for
  Jason's Image Gallery. Thanks to those who helped me come up
  with the name. Now collect yourself, and get busy jiggling those photos!
- Hopefully last release candidate.
- Added two new options, -gb|--go-back and -gburl|--go-back-url.
  Using -gb will prepend a link entitled "Go Back" to the top of the header
  on the index.html page. By default the link will go back to "..", the
  previous directory. You can use the -gburl option to set a differnt url.
- ChangeLog moved from top of jigl.pl file to it's own file.
- Fixed a bug which was caused by an output change in newer versions of
  the convert utility.
- Added support for png files. (now support jpg, gif and png)
- Changed the way we get the file size of the slides from using the
  'identify' program to using the perl function - much cleaner solution.
  Also removed the sizeToKb function since it's now useless.
====================
Version : 1.0rc3
Date    : 03/04/2003
- Third release candidate.
- Turned link-original option off by default
- Added -ws|--watermark-slides option for watermarking slides.
- Added -wf|--watermark-file option for overriding the watermark file name
- Added -wg|--watermark-gravite option for overriding the location of the
  watermark on the image
- Cleaned up the --help printout a bit.
- fixed bug in getImgInfo which would bomb trying to get size/xy info
  if the filename had certain chars. in it.
====================
Version : 1.0rc2
Date    : 11/01/2002
- Second release candidate.
- Removed dependency on ImageMagickVersion in the getImgInfo function.
- Fixed some slide templates to work correctly when info went off the
  edge of the screen.
- Removed dependency on the File::Copy function by using convert instead
  of mogrify

- The first release candidate. Heavy testing begins.
- The majority of useful options have been implimented.
